# monaco-react-json

This repository contains a minimal example of using `@typefox/monaco-editor-react` to create a JSON editor with schema validation in a React application, using the Monaco Editor.

The TypeFox Monaco Editor React component is a wrapper around various CodinGame Monaco Editor packages. They generally support two ways of adding JSON language features: "standalone" language workers, and full default language features packages. This example uses the standalone JSON language features and workers (not the default language features).

This repository is a result of the following discussion: https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient/discussions/948.
